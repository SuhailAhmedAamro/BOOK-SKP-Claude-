## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a transformative convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world, enabling machines to **perceive**, **understand**, and **interact** with their environments in intelligent ways.

### Core Capabilities

At its core, Physical AI combines three fundamental capabilities:

| Capability | Description | Example Technologies |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Perception** | Sensing and understanding the environment | Computer vision, LiDAR, tactile sensors |
| **Cognition** | Processing information and making decisions | Neural networks, world models, planning |
| **Action** | Physical interaction with the world | Robotic arms, autonomous vehicles, actuators |

## The Evolution from Digital to Physical Intelligence {#evolution}

The journey toward Physical AI began with purely computational AI systems. Deep learning revolution brought vision and NLP, but Physical AI adds the dimension of **real-world physics**.

## Key Components of Physical AI Systems {#key-components}

### 1. Perception and Sensing
Physical AI systems rely on multiple sensor modalities:
- **LiDAR**: 3D point clouds for depth.
- **IMUs**: Tracking orientation and acceleration.
- **Tactile Sensors**: Measuring force and pressure.

### 2. World Models
Advanced systems can simulate potential actions before executing them. A robot's world model predicts physics constraints like gravity and friction.

### 3. Decision-Making and Planning
Physical AI systems use a hierarchy:
1. High-Level Task Planning
2. Motion Planning (A*, RRT)
3. Low-Level Control (PID, MPC)

## Applications Transforming Industries {#applications}

- **Manufacturing**: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in warehouses.
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots with sub-millimeter accuracy.
- **Agriculture**: Autonomous tractors and weeding robots.

## Challenges and Frontiers {#challenges}

### 1. The Sim-to-Real Gap
Models trained in simulation often fail in the real world due to unpredictable lighting or friction.

### 2. Computational Demands
Real-time processing (under 100ms latency) requires powerful hardware:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM).
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

## Summary

1. ✅ Physical AI bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical action.
2. ✅ It requires a tight loop of Perception, Cognition, and Action.
3. ✅ High-performance hardware is essential for real-world deployment.
